# nano lisp written in SCN (Solution Centric Notation) then t2t to Common Lisp, etc
main points:
- Sector Lisp written in a higher level langage - SCN - which compiles to other 3GLs
- using Tunney's tiny ABC garbage collector (true FP) instead of mutation and shared memory RAM-style GC
- uses Unicode instead of ASCII
- cell contains (glyph . ptr) or (ptr . ptr)

# Status
- rebuilding from scratch
